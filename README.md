## INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.

__TNM staging system__ The most commonly used tool that doctors use to describe the stage of the cancer. Doctors use the results from diagnostic tests and scans to answer these questions:<br/>

  __Tumor (T):__ How large is the primary tumor? Where is it located?
  __Node (N):__ Has the tumor spread to the lymph nodes? If so, where and how many?
  __Metastasis (M):__ Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body? If so, where and how much?
   The __“N”__ in the __TNM staging system__ stands for __lymph nodes__.<br/>
  
  __Clinical staging:__ Evaluates the lymph nodes __before the surgery__, based on other tests and/or a physical examination.
  __Pathologic staging:__ Evaluates the lymph nodes __after the surgery__, which is a more accurate assessment.
  
      - NX: The lymph nodes were not evaluated.
      - N0: Either No cancer was found in the lymph nodes or Only areas of cancer smaller than 0.2 mm are in the lymph nodes.
      - N1: The cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and/or the internal mammary lymph nodes.
      - N2: The cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes. Or it has spread to the internal mammary lymph nodes, but not the     axillary lymph nodes.
      - N3: The cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes. Or it has spread to the lymph nodes located under 
      
__Problem Statment :__ 
- How many survived after 5 years and how many died before 5 years?
- How the Positive axillary nodes (Pathologic staging) and survivals are related?
- How Survivals and Age and Axillary nodes are related?
- How the survivals and year of operation related?

## DATA
| Column Name             | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------------     |:-------------                                                                                           | 
| __Age__                 | Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)                                                         | 
| __Years_of_operation__  | Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)                                                    |  
| __Pos_axillary_nodes__  | Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)                                                  | 
| __Status__              | Surival status (class attribute) (1=patient survived 5 years or longer,2=patient died within 5 year)    |     
## Data Profiling
- In the upcoming sections we will first __understand our dataset__ using various pandas functionalities.
- Then with the help of __pandas profiling__ we will find which columns of our dataset need preprocessing.
- In __preprocessing__ we will deal with erronous and missing values of columns. 
- Again we will do __pandas profiling__ to see how preprocessing have transformed our dataset.

## Data preparation
- There is no discrepancies found in the data 
- Year of operation is of two digits
- Found __44.4% zeros__ of __Pos_axillary_nodes__, but these are also __valid__ data, which indicates early stages of cancer – Either No cancer was found in the lymph nodes or only areas of cancer smaller than 0.2 mm are in the lymph nodes.
- Converted two digits year of operation to four digits
- Create additional column PAN_Stage which computes Pos_axillary_nodes and categorizes each patient with different pathological stages of cancer.
- Create Survival Bracket column

Swarm plot trend shows as the positive auxiliary nodes increase the survival rate decreases.
<br>We see the blue dots (>5years) predominating in the case where stage __increases from N0 to N3__
<br>And as the __stage increased from N0__ the __red__ dots started to outnumber the blue showing the __fall in the survival(<5years)__
<br>Majority of deaths happened between 1958 and 1966 after that there was decline for both (<5 and >5 years)

- __Violin Plot:__ Positive Axillary Nodes
<p align="left">
  <img width="800" height="300" src="images/output_67_2.png">
  <br>
  VIOLIN plot shows clearly that women who couldn't survive <5 years after operation was due to the contraction of high positive axillary lymph nodes which decreased the chances of their survival.

  <br>
  The age is normally distributed whereas the positive axillary nodes is right skewed.<br>
  Age is normally distributed between >5year and <5years survivals and the mean is around 50 years for both.<br>
  Majority of deaths happened between 1959 and 1966 after that there was declined due to good invention of better medications for both (<5 and >5 years)
</p>


Notice  
- Rate of patients __survival is more when postivie axillary numbers are low in number, which means initital stages of patholigical stage__
- Rate of patients survival after 5 years __decreases__ as pathologic stage __progresess to next stage__
- Stage __N0 as better chance than N3__

- __Heat Plot:__ Pathologic staging / Survived Distribution

  <br>
  There is positive correlation between Positive axillary nodes and Status(Survival) which is also proven by using the violin and swarm plot.
